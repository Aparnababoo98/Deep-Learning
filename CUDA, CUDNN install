To work in Deep Learning using System GPU, you have to download and install CUDA and CUDNN.
I have download CUDA 11.2  and CUDNN xxx should be compatible with the installed CUDA version. (You can check the compatibility of CUDNN from the website).
(CUDA toolkit download link- https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-11.2.0-download-archive?target_os=Windows&target_arch=x86_64)
(CUDNN download link- https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn-downloads)
After downloading the CUDNN zip, extract the folder and paste all the folder in CUDA respective folder of CUDA. 
Copy folder Lib, Include etc. from CUDNN and paste the same in CUDA lib, include etc. folder.
Then go to Environment variables and edit ,paste the path of CUDA BIN, LIB path.
Download and install Visual studio community and must select Desktop Development with C++, Data Science and Analytical Applications,MSVC v143 - VS 2022 C++ x64/x86 build tools,C++ CMake tools for Windows,Windows 10/11 SDK,
Then ..
Restart the system and open VS code
Connect to your environment 
conda activate <your-environment-name>
then run the following code
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU'))"
python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())"

import tensorflow as tf
print("Num GPUs Available: ", len(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')))

Note: for tensorflow use the version 10.2 only. This version only use the system gpu.
for py torch
import torch
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
print("Using device:", device)
